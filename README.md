# CSE5335-gxd2537
Project 2

a. I chose MongoDB, because I used it previously and it has an easy query language.

b. Backend and database part was easy because the structure of node is similar to that of other languages, and the syntax was easy because of javascript.

c. Implementing the animations was difficult because it is a totally new thing that I never saw. Also the directives' usage was a bit difficult to understand

d. Concerns with NodeJS include the language used, which is Javascript. It is not a modular language like Java. So code maintenance could be an issue to deal with.
